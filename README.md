# SahneSH
SahneSH is a shell developed by Sahne Dünya that adopts a unique approach compatible with the Sahne64 API. Like "Fish" in the Unix world, this shell aims to be user-friendly. Shortcuts are supported directly in its native code, without relying on external libraries. It also features auto-completion and suggestions, syntax highlighting, zero-configuration, web-based configuration, and more intuitive scripting. None of these features are found in the commonly used "Bash" shell in the Unix world. The modern "Fish" shell later emerged, but the standard shell for the Sahne Karnal architecture already possesses these features. Of course, there are usage differences, as this shell was designed not for Unix systems but for Sahne Dünya's independent project Sahne Karnal, and it uses standard system calls from the Sahne64 API. Shells play a significant role in the operating system. In text-based operating systems, they directly affect the user experience, while in GUI-based operating systems, they affect the terminal experience. If you're curious about how to use them, open and read the "manual.md" file.
